Is the Github documentation - commits and README - thorough and descriptive?

Should probably commit more often, commit descriptions could have more detail.

Is the code easy to read (good indentation, spacing, naming)?

Code is easy to read, indentation is excellent. A couple of nitpicks: the 
elements in the head tags should be on the same indentation, and you can 
reduce your hidden0, hidden1, etc classes to a single class and apply css 
and jquery to all of them. Other than that, looks good.

Were jQuery effects used for user interaction?

jQuery looks good, no complaints

Is the web page(s) styled using Bootstrap and CSS?

Styling looks good too, love the push button!

Is the site user-friendly?

Yes

Do you have any additional constructive criticism or positive feedback to share?

Everything looks good, thumbs up for responsive design. Just remember to 
commit more often.
